An application for selling flowers and gift items categorized into different sections, each containing a few products. 
In the address section, you can add and delete addresses. 
Additionally, if addresses are not deleted, they will remain the same when you reopen the application. 
The shopping cart contains the added products along with their total quantity, total price, and a section to select addresses from those added in the address section.
You can place your order by clicking the order button or empty your cart by clicking the empty cart button. 
Forgot to place an order and closed the cart? No worries! 
Your cart is saved just like the addresses and will greet you in the same state when you open the application again.
